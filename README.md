# Text Authenticity Analyzer

A modern web-based interface designed to analyze whether a piece of text appears human-written or AI-generated.

🚀 Live Demo: [https://aitextanalyzer.vercel.app/]

---

## 🧠 Overview

Text Authenticity Analyzer is a frontend prototype for an NLP-powered analysis tool that evaluates text based on structured metrics such as:

- AI Likelihood Score
- Perplexity (planned backend metric)
- Sentence Variance
- Vocabulary Richness
- Analytical Summary

The current version focuses on clean UI/UX design and user interaction flow.

---

## ✨ Features

- Minimal, modern dark-themed interface
- Large responsive text input area
- Character counter
- Analysis results section with:
  - AI Likelihood score (progress bar)
  - Key linguistic metrics
  - Summary explanation
- Fully responsive design
- Deployed live using Vercel

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

Frontend:
- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel (Deployment)

---

## ⚠️ Current Status

This is currently a **frontend prototype**.

The analysis logic is simulated and does not yet use a real NLP model.

---

## 🔜 Planned Improvements

Future backend integration will include:

- FastAPI backend
- GPT-2 based perplexity scoring
- Stylometric analysis
- Deterministic metric calculation
- Real NLP model inference
- API integration between frontend and backend

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to evolve into a technically credible full-stack NLP application that analyzes linguistic structure rather than relying on binary AI detection claims.

---

## 📌 Disclaimer

AI detection is a probabilistic problem.  
This project aims to provide analytical insights rather than definitive classification.
